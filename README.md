# Nixpkgs-flox

by flox

------

This repository provides a catalog of successful Nixpkgs builds over time
along with flake-based accessors for reliable, versioned access to Nixpkgs.
It is designed for use with [flox](https://floxdev.com), the Multi-Platform
and Reproducible Environment Manager.

## Catalog

The catalog provides snapshots of successful nixpkgs evaluations over time
for all major systems. Catalog metadata is separated by system type and
is served from individual branches containing unrelated commit trees.
